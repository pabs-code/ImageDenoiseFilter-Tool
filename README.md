# ImageEnhancerTool with Streamlit

A simple image processing web app built using **Streamlit** application designed to demonstrate various image processing techniques, including Gaussian Blur, Median Filtering, PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). This app allows users to upload an image and apply these filters, viewing the processed images alongside their original counterpart. It also provides metrics to quantitatively compare the differences between the original and filtered images.  As well as, view histograms of RGB color channels for each image.

## Project Overview

This project is a **web-based image processing application** built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to:

- Upload images in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format.
- Apply Gaussian Blur and Median Filtering techniques.
- View processed images side-by-side with the original.
- Calculate metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).
- Save the processed images to disk.

It's ideal for educational purposes, image processing experiments, or quick prototyping in a web environment.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies** using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit numpy opencv-python pillow scikit-image matplotlib
   ```

2. **Save the code in a file**, for example: `app.py`.

3. **Run the app with Streamlit**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
---

## Usage

1. **Upload an image (JPG/JPEG/PNG)**: Use the file uploader to load an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
2. **Adjust Parameters for Image Processing**:
   - Adjust Gaussian Blur kernel size and sigma
   - Adjust Median Filter kernel size
3. **View Processed Results:** After adjusting, you'll see three side-by-side images:
   - Original
   - Gaussian Blurred Image
   - Median Filtered Image
4. **Compute Metrics**: The app will automatically calculate and display the following metrics for each processed image:
   - **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) in dB
   - **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
5. **Save Processed Images**:You can click "Save Processed Images" to save both results as JPEG files.
6. **View Color Histograms**: There's an option to view histograms of RGB color channels for each image. Display histograms of the RGB channels for the original, Gaussian-blurred, and median-filtered images.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into a single Python script (`app.py`) with the following key components:

- `ImageProcessor`: A class that handles image loading, processing, and metric computation.
- `main()`: The Streamlit app entry point that defines UI layout, input handling, and output rendering.

## Technical Notes

- The application uses **OpenCV** for image processing and **Streamlit** for the web interface.
- Images are loaded as NumPy arrays, processed using OpenCV filters (Gaussian Blur & Median Filter), and displayed in RGB format.
- PSNR and SSIM metrics are computed to evaluate the quality of the processed images.
- Histograms are visualized using **Matplotlib**.

## Filtering Techniques and Metrics Definitions  

- **Gaussian Blur**  
   A smoothing filter that reduces noise by averaging pixel values with a Gaussian distribution kernel. Ideal for reducing fine details but can blur edges.  

- **Median Filter**  
   A non-linear filter that replaces each pixel with the median of its neighbors, effective against salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges better than Gaussian filters.  

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**  
   Calculates the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise. Higher values indicate less distortion.  
   
   **Formula**:  
$$
\text{PSNR} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{MAX}_I^2}{\text{MSE}}\right)
$$  

- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**  
   Measures the structural similarity between two images based on luminance, contrast, and structure. Values range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity.
